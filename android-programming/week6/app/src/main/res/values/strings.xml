    <string name="piece_of_star_information">This Star Sculpture Club is a hobby volunteer club of Hansung University that observes and studies astronomical objects. Regular astronomical observation studies are conducted by renting a regular astronomical observation school classroom on the school roof using the telescope provided by the club. In addition, once or twice per semester, we visit the observatory and find a good place for stargazing, carry a telescope and conduct stargazing.</string>
